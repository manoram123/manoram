Astrology, known as "Jyotisha" in Hinduism, is an ancient system of knowledge that explores the relationship between the positions of celestial bodies and events on Earth. The word "Jyotisha" is derived from the Sanskrit words "jyoti," meaning light, and "isha," meaning lord or deity. Therefore, Jyotisha can be translated as the "science of light" or the "science of celestial bodies."

In Hindu astrology, the positions of celestial bodies such as planets and stars at the time of a person's birth are believed to influence their life and destiny. The Hindu astrological system is quite intricate and encompasses various branches, including:

1. **Natal Astrology (Janma Kundali):** This is the most common form of astrology and involves the preparation of a birth chart or horoscope based on the exact time, date, and place of an individual's birth. The birth chart, known as "Janma Kundali" or "Natal Chart," provides insights into various aspects of a person's life, such as career, relationships, health, and overall destiny.

1. **Muhurta (Electional Astrology):** Muhurta is the branch of astrology that deals with selecting auspicious timings for various activities and events. It is used to determine the most favorable times for activities such as weddings, business ventures, or religious ceremonies.

1. **Graha (Planetary) and Rashi (Zodiac Sign) Analysis:** Hindu astrology places significance on the positions of the nine celestial bodies, or "Navagrahas," including the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu. Each planet is associated with specific qualities and influences, and their placement in different houses of the horoscope can impact various aspects of a person's life.

1. **Dashas and Mahadashas:** Hindu astrology uses planetary periods, known as "Dashas" and "Mahadashas," to predict the timing of events in an individual's life. These periods are determined based on the position of the Moon at the time of birth and are used to analyze the influence of specific planets during specific time intervals.
